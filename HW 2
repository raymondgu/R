Assignment 2 Housing Data
This homework deals with data from the Bay Area and the housing market over the past few years(from 2003 to 2006). This is an interesting segment of the market to look at given the recent housing bubble crash and its impact on the economy.
Question 1
We first want to look at how many houses were sold in the brief time of the data. To do this, we use the function:
 length(housing$county)=
[1] 281506

This gives the sum of the housing sales in each of the counties and the total which is 281,506. It seems like a normal amount of houses sold given that the bay area is a top choice for families due to jobs and opportunities available here. 
Question 2
Next we investigate the time period that the data covers. 
period = housing$date[order(housing$date)]
This function gives the order of the dates from earliest to latest. By using a head and tail function, I learned that the earliest date is 04/27/03 and the latest 06/04/06. Looking at the calendar I was able to find out that this translates to around 793 days.
Question 3
The next question gets a little trickier as we have to find the number of houses sold in each county. Fortunately, table(housing$county) does the job: 
Alameda: 60410
Contra Costa: 59381
Marin: 10450
Napa: 5066
SF: 8137
San Mateo: 22558
Santa Clara: 70424
Solano: 23404 
Sonoma: 21676


It makes sense that Napa county has the least number of homes sold because it is primarily taken over by wineries and vineyards. Large residential and suburban communities have the most number of homes sold and this can be seen in the new developments in Alameda and Santa Clara County which translates to a high volume of homes sold. 
Question 4
The next question asks how many houses were sold in each county each year. It is a lot more tricky and I had to go to office hours to figure this out. First we make table(housing$date) which creates a table of the housing vector and the date column subset. Then we create a variable called b= cut(housing$date, "year") which cuts the “year” part of the output and stores it in b. Next we run table(b)
> table(b)
b
2003-01-01 2004-01-01 2005-01-01 2006-01-01 
     60311     100593      91894      28708

	It creates a table of the frequencies of each year from 2003 to 20006. Then we use tapply to create a for loop to see these yearly frequencies in each county
tapply(b, housing$county, table)

This shows how many homes were sold in each county throughout 2003 to 2006. It is interesting to note that sales peaked in 2004 and began to taper off and then dramatically plummet in 2006. This directly translates to the housing bubble crash as tons of homes were foreclosed due to buyers defaulting on their loans.
Question 5
	We now look at the average price of a home in the bay area. It is relatively simple as we can just do summary(housing$price)
> summary(housing$price)
    Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
   22000   400000   530000   602000   700000 20000000

It shows that the mean price is 602,000 dollars. There are some crazy outliers pulling the mean up and there is a max of 20000000. The median is a better estimator of the middle price because it is not affected as much by outliers and shows a value of 530,000 dollars. 
Question 6
	The next question asks which county has the largest average price per square foot. We start by looking at the unique counties so we don’t have to deal with duplicates. 
unicounty = unique(housing$county)

This creates a variable that houses each of the nine counties. Next we run a for loop through sapply:
test=sapply(unicounty, function(x){
  co.in = housing$county %in% x
  tm = housing[co.in, ]
  a = mean(tm$price/tm$bsqft, na.rm = TRUE)
})
We run the unicounty variable and thus each of the nine counties through a loop and it creates an index which has each of the price and bsqft of the counties and outputs the average of it in a variable called a.
> test

[8] Solano County        Sonoma County       
Levels: Alameda County Contra Costa County Marin County Napa County San Francisco County San Mateo County Santa Clara County Solano County Sonoma County
> names(test) = unicounty
> which.max(test)
San Francisco County 

Next we run the test variable which spits out the averages prices per sq ft of the nine counties. How do we find out which average is which county? We do names(test)=unicounty to match them and then do which.max(test) to find the highest one which is SF. It makes sense because SF generally has the highest housing prices and is a major city. 
Question 7:
The next question asks what county has the largest variation in housing prices per bedroom. I approached this question in a similar vein of the previous question. The coding is very similar 
unicounty = unique(housing$county)
test=sapply(unicounty, function(x){
     co.in = housing$county %in% x
     temp = housing[co.in, ]
     a = max(temp$price/temp$br)-min(temp$price/temp$br)
})
I just replaced the logical operations and variables inside the a variable to price and bedroom. The next few lines of code are also very similar. 
unicounty
names(test) = unicounty
test
which.max(test)
It gives an output of Napa county as the highest variation of price per bedroom and it makes sense because Napa is different from most counties in that it is mostly vineyards and wineries. 
Question 8:
This question asks us average price per sq ft of houses b/t 2 and 4 bedrooms in Berkeley with 1000 to 3000 sq ft OR which have lot size > 90% of Bay Area houses. It is different from previous questions in that it deals with logical values. 
First we create an index of Berkeley inside the city subset:
in.be = housing$city == "Berkeley"
Then we create a variable of the housing vector with the index:
temp.be = housing[in.be, ]
Next is the hard part as we must bring in the Boolean conditions and then create an index to find the mean. 
bo = (temp.be$br >= 2 & temp.be$br <= 4) & (temp.be$bsqft >= 1000 & temp.be$bsqft <= 3000) | temp.be$lsqft > quantile(housing$lsqft, .90, na.rm =TRUE) 
in.bo = bo == "TRUE"
temp.bo = housing[in.bo, ]
mean(temp.bo$price/temp.bo$bsqft, na.rm = TRUE)
[1] 390.5074

Question 9:
This question asks us to find 5 houses with strange characteristics
I wanted to find houses which were priced at exorbitant values. 
 sum(housing$price > 10000000)
It showed 5 houses with prices above this extremely high value which is very suspicious given that the median home price was only $500,000. 
housing[housing$price > 10000000, ]

These 5 houses were usual in that there prices were all above 1 billion. There could be a mistake in the typing and there was an extra zero.
Next I tried to look up my own house to see if there was anything strange. My house was purchased within the range of 2003 to 2006 and I looked at the data to search for my street name. 
sum(housing$street == "4173 Holland Drive")
housing[housing$street == "4173 Holland Drive", ]

Looking at the output, there was something off with the number of bedrooms. It said that my house only had 1 bedroom when in fact there were 4. 
Question 10:
The last question asks to find houses with $ per sq ft > $3000 and order data frame from highest to lowest. 
sum(housing$price/housing$bsqft > 3000, na.rm = TRUE)
The code above shows that there are 23 such houses above $3000.
na.omit(housing[housing$price/housing$bsqft > 3000, ])
temp1 = na.omit(housing[housing$price/housing$bsqft > 3000, ])
This outputs the prices

Question 1: Reproducing Plot
We are asked to replicate a plot of the graph shown on the homework. To do this, we must use the table function to obtain the counties and weeks while using the lattice library. The overall plot is reproduced using the codes below. In terms of how it can be improved, I would focus on making the lines more distinctive and easier to differentiate from each other. Also it might be easier to use multiple plots because there seems to be so much going on in this single plot. I would code in R to create 9 plots for easier comparison and then 

library(lattice)
  
table(housing$wk, housing$county)

c=as.matrix(table(housing$wk, housing$county))

matplot(c, type="l", xlim=c(0,150), ylim=c(0,600), ann = FALSE)
legend("topleft",legend= c("Alameda County county","Contra Costa county", "Marin county", "Napa county", "SF county", "San Mateo county","Santa Clara county","Solano county","Sonoma county"),cex=0.25,)       
title(xlab="weeks",ylab="Number of houses sold")
title(main="Number of houses sold by week in each county")

 
Question 2 Scatterplot
Next we will look at t 

in.al = housing$county == "Alameda County"
housing[in.al, ]
temp.al = housing[in.al, ]
plot(temp.al$price, temp.al$bsqft, ylim=c(0,4500), xlim=c(0,4e+06))
points(temp.al$bsqft)

> colprice=c("green", rep("red",3), rep("yellow",2),"blue", rep("purple",2))
 Question 4 
In order to compare distributions of housing prices by county we can use other types of plots to use different interpretations of the data. Another way to visualize it is through a box and whisker plot. The box and whisker plot can display the 9 counties in side by side comparison. Thus we can better compare the differences of the distributions.
bwplot(housing$price~housing$county,ylab="price",xlab="county",main="price of houses sold in each county" )
  

I haven’t figured out a way to clean the x axis yet and it still looks very jumbled but we can see from the dot plot that there are a few very high outliers that full the mean of the counties.
Critiquing Plots
1.	This first plot can be improved by making the colors more differentiable rather than all just 50 shades of grey. I would suggest using colors that are very noticeable from each other such as red, green, blue, etc. Afterwards, there also needs to be a legend to list what the colors represent or the individual counties can be labeled on the x-axis. The y-axis also be labeled with the “houses sold” to let the reader what is being measured.
2.	The 4 plots are confusing to read separately. It would be better if they were combined into one 3D plot or box and whisker plot. That way, the reader can better visualize the graphs as one entity rather as many separate ones. Also the y-axis goes too high due to outliers and this distorts the graph. This can be avoided if we use a box and whisker plot instead.

The overall plot is reproduced using the codes below. In terms of how it can be improved, I would focus on making the lines more distinctive and easier to differentiate from each other. Also it might be easier to use multiple plots because there seems to be so much going on in this single plot. I would code in R to create 9 plots for easier comparison and then 
library(lattice)
table(housing$wk, housing$county)
c=as.matrix(table(housing$wk, housing$county))
matplot(c, type="l", xlim=c(0,150), ylim=c(0,600), ann = FALSE)
legend("topleft",legend= c("Alameda County county","Contra Costa county", "Marin county", "Napa county", "SF county", "San Mateo county","Santa Clara county","Solano county","Sonoma county"),cex=0.25,)       
title(xlab="weeks",ylab="Number of houses sold")
title(main="Number of houses sold by week in each county")

 

Question 2 Scatterplot
in.al = housing$county == "Alameda County"
housing[in.al, ]
temp.al = housing[in.al, ]
plot(temp.al$price, temp.al$bsqft, ylim=c(0,4500), xlim=c(0,4e+06))
points(temp.al$bsqft)
