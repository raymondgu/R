We start with installing the package and setting up the library for using the database. The following functions are used: install.packages("RSQLite")and library(RSQLite). After we have done this, we can look at the many aspects of baseball through the 24 tables inside this database. 
	To begin, we establish a driver to this connection: drv = dbDriver("SQLite"). After this is done, we connect to the location of the sqlite file by con = dbConnect(drv, "C:/Users/raymond/Desktop/baseball-archive-2011.sqlite"). Now we can continue working with the data. 
	We open the tables inside the database and see what is inside:
> dbListTables(con)
[1] "AllstarFull"         "Appearances"         "AwardsManagers"      "AwardsPlayers"       "AwardsShareManagers" "AwardsSharePlayers"  "Batting"
[8] "BattingPost"         "Fielding"            "FieldingOF"          "FieldingPost"        "HallOfFame"          "Managers"            "ManagersHalf"
[15] "Master"              "Pitching"            "PitchingPost"        "Salaries"            "Schools"             "SchoolsPlayers"      "SeriesPost"
[22] "Teams"               "TeamsFranchises"     "TeamsHalf"

There are 24 tables we can work with and some of the interesting ones seem to be the Master, Teams, and the batting statistics and such. In order to list the columns values inside a table such as Teams, we do: 
> dbListFields(con, "Teams")
 [1] "yearID"         "lgID"           "teamID"         "franchID"       "divID"          "Rank"           "G"              "Ghome"          "W"             
[10] "L"              "DivWin"         "WCWin"          "LgWin"          "WSWin"          "R"              "AB"             "H"              "2B"            
[19] "3B"             "HR"             "BB"             "SO"             "SB"             "CS"             "HBP"            "SF"             "RA"            
[28] "ER"             "ERA"            "CG"             "SHO"            "SV"             "IPouts"         "HA"             "HRA"            "BBA"           
[37] "SOA"            "E"              "DP"             "FP"             "name"           "park"           "attendance"     "BPF"            "PPF"           
[46] "teamIDBR"       "teamIDlahman45" "teamIDretro"   

Now we can see inside the columns of a given table and can begin working deeper inside the database. For the QUESTION 1, we are asked to look at the years covered and data in each year. Based on the lowest and highest years we can conclude that the data ranges from 1871 to 2011. There is also data in each of these years that we can use and play with.
> years = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT yearID FROM Teams")

> head(years)
  yearID
1   1871
2   1871
3   1871
4   1871
5   1871
6   1871
> max(years)
[1] 2011

	QUESTION 2 focuses on the number of unique people such players, managers, etc. To find the total number of people in the baseball database, we look at the distinct playerID and managerID and add them up in a variable called distinctpeople and then we call up the variable to see the number. 
> distinctpeople = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT playerID) + COUNT(DISTINCT managerID) FROM Master;")

> distinctpeople
  COUNT(DISTINCT playerID) + COUNT(DISTINCT managerID)
1                                                18410

 Next we are finding the total number of players and managers. To see these values we do: 
> players = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT playerID) from Master")
> players
  COUNT(DISTINCT playerID)
1                    17736

> managers = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT managerID) from Master")
> managers
  COUNT(DISTINCT managerID)
1                       674

QUESTION 3 wants to find the team that won the World Series in year 2000. We can do this by: 
> worldwon = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT teamID FROM Teams WHERE WSWin ='Y'AND yearID = 2000 ")
> worldwon
  teamID
1    NYA

QUESTION 4 asks us to find which team lost the World Series each year. 
> WSLOSER = (dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT name, yearID FROM Teams WHERE LgWIN = 'Y' AND WSWin = 'N' AND yearID > 1902;"))

> WSLOSER
                      name yearID

107          Texas Rangers   2011

QUESTION 5: What is the relationship between the number of games won and winning the world series. To look at the correlation between the two, I looked at whether winning a divison title, meaning they had the most wins out of the teams in their division affected their outcome in the world series. From the data, we can see that it is unusual for a non-division winner to win the World Series.  
> relations = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT yearID, teamID FROM Teams WHERE DivWin = 'Y' AND WSWin = 'N';")
> relations

QUESTION 6: What are the top 3 salaries of 2003? To look at the top three players with the highest salaries we implement:
> salary = dbGetQuery(con, "Select * FROM Salaries WHERE yearID ==2003")

We can see that the top three salaries are 22 million, 20 million and 18 million and 700 thousand.  
QUESTION 7: What is the payroll of each team and plot

Question 8: Have salaries kept up with inflation? To do this question, I downloaded a txt file from online:  
ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt

and loaded it into R. Next I looked at the average salary of a baseball player:
> avgsal = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT avg(salary) FROM Salaries")
> avgsal
  avg(salary)
1     1673224

dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT yearID, avg(salary) FROM Salaries")
I would then proceed to look at the average salaries of many other years and compare that to the rate of inflation. Looking at the CPI and the rate of change for the average salary, I would say that the players’ salaries have increased at a higher rate than inflation. Therefore, it is true to say that becoming a baseball player comes with much better benefits that before.
Question 9: Compare payroll for teams in same leagues and then divisions. Connection with performace?  We begin doing this question by looking at the different leagues each team belongs to and separate the teams into the two leagues. Afterwards, we compare the salaries of the two leagues: dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT lgID, salary FROM Salaries "). Looking at the table, we can see the differences of salaries between the two leagues. It is interesting to note that the bigger the city, the higher the payroll. We also notice that certain teams have a trend of having high payrolls: dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT teamID, salary FROM Salaries "). This may be due to the fact some cities are major and have a large population of civilians and fans such as New York, LA, SF, etc. There is indeed a ratio between payroll and performance with higher payroll teams having higher batting averages: dbGetQuery(con, “SELECT RBI, teamID FROM Batting”).
Question 10: Has distribution of home runs increased? To approach this question we look at the number of home runs completed in each year and see if there is a trend from the data. Based off of the data produced from: dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT HR, yearID FROM Batting") and through this we can see that home runs have been increasing throughout each year possibly through improvements in training as well as medical breakthroughs such as steriods.
